Dynamic Equations of Hexacopter explained in detail

Step-1: Choosing Configuration

The orientation given by three Euler angles [phi, theta, psi] where (-pi/2 < phi,theta < pi/2) and (-pi < psi <pi)

Step-2: Forces and Torques acting on body
Forces:
1) Thrust
2) Gravity
3) Drag(It is the opposing force to the traveling of the solid body in air resulted from the aerodynamic friction)
4) Disturbance(Other forces like the Coriolis force from the earth, the wind and Euler forces are considered as a disturbance)

Torques:



step-3: Dynamic Equations
1) Translational Dynamics:



2) Rotational Dynamics:
